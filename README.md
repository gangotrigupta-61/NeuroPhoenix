## Inspiration

Mental health challenges among students and young professionals are rising, often due to academic pressure, isolation, and lack of accessible support. Being students ourselves, we noticed how difficult it can be to manage stress silently. NeuroPhoenix was born from this concern—to offer an empathetic space for self‑expression, relaxation, and guided support using AI and simple self‑care activities.
